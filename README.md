# PolishAPI

An API for clean buttons, widgets, and screens.

## Simple Widgets

Basic widgets that don't do a ton. Currently, there are:

- Textbox Widget - input text into it
- Toggle button - an on/off switch
- Checkbox button - a checkbox
- Clean Button - a button with rounded corners
- Simple Button - a button without rounded corners
- Slider buttons - slide a circle around to select a value
- Selector Button - choose between different options

## Complex Widgets

Widgets that allow for more customizability, but are more complex.

- Color Button - select a color with 4 different sliders
- Dropdown Selector - selector Button, but with dropdown functionality
- Simple Button List - a scrollable list for Simple Buttons
- Entry Button List - use different savable entries in a scrollable list

## Credits

A lot of this I would have had no idea how to do if it weren't for shedaniel's [ClothConfig](https://github.com/shedaniel/cloth-config/). It was a huge help on learning how builders, interfaces, implementation, and overall API layout works. Please do check it out if you haven't already.
